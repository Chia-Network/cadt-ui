# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list

### Contributing

All branches should be created from the `develop` branch and not from `main`.  All pull requests should be made against the `develop` branch, unless it is a new release.  The `develop` branch will be merged into the `main` branch to create a release.  Automation in the CI will create the [release](https://github.com/Chia-Network/cadt/releases) and attach the installation files to it automatically whenever code is merged to `main`.  Additionally, the changelog will automatically be updated in the `main` branch.  Therefore, the `main` branch should always be a representation of the latest released code.  

​This repo uses a [commit convention](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). A typical commit message might read:
​
```
    fix: correct home screen layout
```
​
The first part of this is the commit "type". The most common types are "feat" for new features, and "fix" for bugfixes. Using these commit types helps us correctly manage our version numbers and changelogs. Since our release process calculates new version numbers from our commits it is very important to get this right.
​

- `feat` is for introducing a new feature
- `fix` is for bug fixes
- `docs` for documentation only changes
- `style` is for code formatting only
- `refactor` is for changes to code which should not be detectable by users or testers
- `perf` is for a code change that improves performance
- `test` is for changes which only touch test files or related tooling
- `build` is for changes which only touch our develop/release tools
- `ci` is for changes to the continuous integration files and scripts
- `chore` is for changes that don't modify code, like a version bump
- `revert` is for reverting a previous commit
  ​
  After the type and scope there should be a colon.
  ​
  The "subject" of the commit follows. It should be a short indication of the change. The commit convention prefers that this is written in the present-imperative tense.
